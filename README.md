This project answers 5 questions regarding the Sales Data (year 2019) of an Electronic Store based out of several cities in the United States of America. 
I have used the Python Libraries Pandas and Matplotlib for answering the following 5 questions :
  <ul>
  <li>1) What was the best month for sales? How much money was earned in that months?</li>
  <li>2) What city had the highest number of sales?</li>
  <li>3) At what time should we display advertisements to maximize the liklihood of customer's buying product?</li>
  <li>4) What are the products that are most often sold together?</li>
  <li>5) What product was sold the most? Any insights would be appreciated..</li>
  </ul>
